## TODO

- document methods
- document usages
- determine how to handle delete without network
- determine how to handle associations
- make API more obvious and idiotproof (annotations are cool)
- return from database before updating with server data for performance (this should be fine thanks to the observer pattern)
- separate factory into ResourceFactory and something to map server json to resource json (server?)
